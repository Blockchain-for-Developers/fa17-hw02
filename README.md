# Homework 2
Welcome to the Blockchain for Developers DeCal's second assignment. You'll be getting acclimated with the offline Ethereum developer environment, in-depth Solidity, and smart contract testing.

## Homework Instructions

For the two exercises, **ex1** and **ex2**, please take a look at the specifications noted in their respective markdowns.

Also feel free to submit your *Homework 1 redemption* file in the root of your repo as well.

For **ex1** you'll be expected to set up your developer environment, if you haven't already. This includes installing npm, Truffle, and testrpc.

For **ex2** you'll be coding up a complicated betting smart contract. This is significantly harder than **ex1**; please pace yourself accordingly and start early! You have been warned.

## Submission Instructions

Please fork this repo and push your code up to your fork. Please fill out this Google form to let us know where you've got your answers: https://goo.gl/forms/XDnV9J1k9lM2f8312.

Please feel free to reach out to the staff via Piazza should you run into any trouble.
